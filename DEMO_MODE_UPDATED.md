## 🎯 **DEMO SCRIPT FOR JUDGES**

### **Opening:**
> "Welcome to SevaSetu's AI Inference Engine demo. In 10 steps, you'll see how AI predicts waste WITHOUT drones or cameras, using only weak signals."

### **Step 3 (Critical):**
> "Watch this carefully - AI is merging 4 weak signals that are individually useless. Only spatio-temporal machine learning can do this. A human cannot manually process these patterns."

### **Step 5 (Wow Moment):**
> "This is tomorrow's waste predicted TODAY. The waste hasn't appeared yet, but AI knows it will. This is prevention, not reaction."

### **Step 6 (Scalability):**
> "Notice the route optimization - 35% time savings means workers serve MORE villages per day. This compounds at scale."

### **Step 9 (Learning):**
> "The AI improves from 65% to 85%+ accuracy. Drones don't learn. Cameras don't improve. Only AI does."

### **Closing:**
> "One AI inference engine manages 1000+ villages with ZERO hardware cost. Drones cost ₹50k-2L each and serve ~5 villages. Software beats hardware for rural India."
